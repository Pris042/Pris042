### Hi!

I am an aspiring software engineer and cyber security specialist. I am extremly passionate about learning new coding langauges, creating cool projects and exploring ethical hacking. I hope to use my skills to create and explore how technology connects us together, as well as how it can be further used in unconventional industries.
